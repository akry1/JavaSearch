You can rename an object in a context by using 
Context.rename().

// Rename to Scott S
ctx.rename("cn=Scott Seligman", "cn=Scott S");


This example renames the object that was bound to "cn=Scott Seligman" to "cn=Scott S". After verifying that the object got renamed, the program renames it to its original name ("cn=Scott Seligman"), as follows.

// Rename back to Scott Seligman
ctx.rename("cn=Scott S", "cn=Scott Seligman");
