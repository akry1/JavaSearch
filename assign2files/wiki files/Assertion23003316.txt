An assertion checks if a condition is true:<br /><br /><br /><br />Code section 3.6: A return statement.<br /><br /><br />1     public int getAge() {<br />2         assert age >= 0;<br />3         return age;<br />4     }<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Each assert statement is ended by a semi-colon (;). However, assertions are disabled by default, so you must run the program with the -ea argument in order for assertions to be enabled (java -ea [name of compiled program]).
