In 1990s, the trend was moving away from Mainframe computing to Client/Server, as the price of Unix servers dropped. The database access and some business logic were centralized on the back-end server, collecting data from the user program was installed on the front-end users' "client" computers. In the Java world there are three main ways the front-end and the back-end could simply communicate.<br /><br />The client application using JDBC to connect the data base server, (Limited business logic on the back-end, unless using Stored procedures)<br />The client application using RMI (Remote Method Invocation) to communicate with the back-end.<br />The client application using socket connection to communicate with the back-end.
