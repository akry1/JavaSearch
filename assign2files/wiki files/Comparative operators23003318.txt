Java has several operators that can be used to compare variables. For example, how would you tell if one variable has a greater value than another? The answer: use the "greater-than" operator.<br />Here is a list of the comparative operators in Java:<br /><br />> : Greater than<br />< : Less than<br />>= : Greater than or equal to<br /><= : Less than or equal to<br />== : Equal to<br />!= : Not equal to<br /><br />To see how these operators are used, look at this example:<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Code section 3.37: Comparisons.<br /><br /><br />1 int a = 5, b = 3;<br />2 System.out.println(a > b); // Value is true because a is greater than b<br />3 System.out.println(a == b); // Value is false because a does not equal b<br />4 System.out.println(a != b); // Value is true because a does not equal b<br />5 System.out.println(b <= a); // Value is true because b is less than a<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Output for code section 3.37<br /><br />true<br />false<br />true<br />true<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Comparative operators can be used on any primitive types (except boolean), but only the "equals" and "does not equal" operators work on objects. This is because the less-than/greater-than operators cannot be applied to objects, but the equivalency operators can.<br /><br /><br /><br />Specifically, the == and != operators test whether both variables point to the same object. Objects will be covered later in the tutorial, in the "Classes, Objects, and Types" module.
