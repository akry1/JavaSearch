This is a MS Windows-only example, due to the requirement for the Microsoft Access Driver.<br /><br /><br />Class.forName("sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver");<br />String path = "C:/example.mdb";<br />String dsn = "jdbc:odbc:Driver={Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb)};DBQ=" + path + ";UID=admin";<br />accessConn = DriverManager.getConnection(dsn, "", "");
