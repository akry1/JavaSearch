A graphical representation of computer memory<br /><br /><br />Variables and all the information they store are kept in the computer's memory for access. Think of a computer's memory as a table of data — where each cell corresponds to a variable.<br />Upon creating a variable, we basically create a new address space and give it a unique name. Java goes one step further and lets you define what you can place within the variable — in Java parlance you call this a data type. So, you essentially have to do two things in order to create a variable:<br /><br />Create a variable by giving it a unique name; and,<br />Define a data type for the variable.<br /><br />The following code demonstrates how a simple variable can be created. This process is known as variable declaration.<br /><br /><br /><br />Code section 3.40: A simple variable declaration.<br /><br /><br />1 int a;
