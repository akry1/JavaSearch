The Java JDK collection implementations are quite powerful and good, so it is unlikely that you will need to write your own. The usage of the different collections are the same but the implementations are different. If the existing collection implementations do not meet your needs, you can write your version of the implementation. Your version of the implementation just needs to implement the same java.util.Collection interface, then you can switch to using your implementation and the code that is using the collection does not need to be changed.<br />Use the Collection interface if you need to keep related (usually the same type of) objects together in a collection where you can:<br /><br />Search for a particular element<br />List the elements<br />Maintain and/or change the order of the elements by using the collection basic operations (Add, Remove, Update,..)<br />Access the elements by an index number<br /><br />The advantages of using the Collection interface are:<br /><br />Gives a generic usage, as we talked about above, it is easy to switch implementation<br />It makes it easy to convert one type of collection to another.<br /><br />The Collection interface defines the following basic operations:<br /><br /><br />boolean add(E o);<br />Using Element type E<br /><br /><br />boolean addAll(Collection c);<br /><br /><br /><br />boolean remove(Object o);<br /><br /><br /><br />boolean removeAll(Collection c);<br /><br /><br /><br />boolean retainAll(Collection c);<br />Return true if the collection has changed due to the operation.<br /><br /><br />Note that in addAll() we can add any type of collection. This is the beauty of using the Collection interface. You can have a LinkedList and just call the addAll(list) method, passing in a list. You can pass in a Vector, an ArrayList, a HashSet, a TreeSet, a YourImpOfCollection, ... All those different types of collection will be magically converted to a LinkedList.<br />Let's have a closer look at this magic. The conversion is easy because the Collection interface defines a standard way of looping through the elements. The following code is a possible implementation of addAll() method of the LinkedList.<br /><br /><br /><br />Code section 5.6: Collection transfer.<br /><br /><br /> 1 import java.util.Collection<br /> 2 import java.util.Iterator<br /> 3 ...<br /> 4 public boolean addAll(Collection coll) {<br /> 5    int sizeBefore = this.size();<br /> 6    Iterator iter = coll.iterator();<br /> 7    while(iter.hasNext()) {<br /> 8       this.add(iter.next());<br /> 9    }<br />10    if (sizeBefore > this.size()) {<br />11       return true;<br />12    } else {<br />13       return false;<br />14    }<br />15 }<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The above code just iterates through the passed in collection and adds the elements to the linked list. You do not have to do that, since that is already defined. What you might need to code for is to loop through a Customer collection:<br /><br /><br /><br />Code section 5.7: Iteration on a collection.<br /><br /><br /> 1 import java.util.Collection<br /> 2 import java.util.Iterator<br /> 3 import java.yourcompany.Customer<br /> 4 ...<br /> 5 public String printCustomerNames(Collection customerColl) {<br /> 6    StringBuffer buf = new StringBuffer();<br /> 7 <br /> 8    Iterator iter = customerColl.iterator();<br /> 9    while(iter.hasNext()) {<br />10       Customer cust = (Customer) iter.next();<br />11       buf.append(cust.getName());<br />12       buf.append( "\n" );<br />13    }<br />14   return buf.toString();<br />15 }<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Notice two things:<br /><br />The above code will work for all type of collections.<br />We have to know the type of objects inside the collection, because we call a method on it.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />To do:<br />Add some exercises like the ones in Variables<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /> Aggregate<br />Java Programming<br />Collection<br />ArrayList
