See also applet markup.<br /><br />To embed an applet in a HTML page, you have to insert a <applet/> markup. This markup can have several attributes:<br /><br /><br />code*<br />The name of the main class to call. It could be the name of the class with or without the .class .<br /><br /><br />height<br />The height of the area where the content of the applet can be rendered on the web page.<br /><br /><br />width<br />The width of the area where the content of the applet can be rendered on the web page.<br /><br /><br />archive<br />The name of a compressed zip archive having .jar extension. The archive can contain all the needed classes to run the applet. Applets are usually delivered in this form, to minimize the download time.<br /><br /><br />The attributes with * are mandatory.<br />There have been some discussions about the usage of applet tag but it still can be used for beginning and also would work in the real world as well.
