Although memory spaces have their own addresses — usually a hash number such as 0xCAD3, etc. — it is much easier to remember a variable's location in the memory if we can give it a recognizable name. Identifiers are the names we give to our variables. You can name your variable anything like aVariable, someVariable, age, someonesImportantData, etcetera. But notice: none of the names we described here has a space within it. Hence, it is pretty obvious that spaces aren't allowed in variable names. In fact, there are a lot of other things that are not allowed in variable names. The things that are allowed are:<br /><br />Characters A to Z and their lower-case counterparts a to z.<br />Numbers 0 to 9. However, numbers should not come at the beginning of a variable's name.<br />And finally, special characters that include only $ (dollar sign) and _ (underscore).<br /><br /><br />Test your knowledge<br /><br />Question 3.6: Which of the ones below are proper variable identifiers?<br /><br />f_name<br />lastname<br />someones name<br />$SomeoneElsesName<br />7days<br />TheAnswerIs42<br /><br /><br />Answer<br /><br />I can tell you that 3 and 5 are not the right way to do things around here, the rest are proper identifiers.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Any valid variable names might be correct but they are not always what you should be naming your variables for a few reasons as listed below:<br /><br />The name of the variable should reflect the value within them.<br />The identifier should be named following the naming guidelines or conventions for doing so. We will explain that in a bit.<br />The identifier shouldn't be a nonsense name like lname, you should always name it properly: lastName is the best way of naming a variable.
