The simpliest way to use a class declared in a package is to prefix the class name with its package:<br /><br /><br /><br />Code section 3.88: Package declaration.<br /><br /><br />1 business.BusinessClass myBusinessClass = new business.BusinessClass();<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />If you are using the class from a class in the same package, you don't have to specify the package. If another class with the same name exists in another package, it will use the local class.<br />The syntax above is a bit verbose. You can import the class by using the import Java keyword at the top of the file and then only specify its name:<br /><br /><br /><br />Code listing 3.15: MyClass.java<br /><br /><br />1 import business.BusinessClass;<br />2 <br />3 public class MyClass {<br />4   public static void main(String[] args) {<br />5     BusinessClass myBusinessClass = new BusinessClass();<br />6   }<br />7 }<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Note that you can't import two classes with the same name in two different packages.<br />The classes Integer and String belongs to the package java.lang but they don't need to be imported as the java.lang package is implicitly imported in all classes.
