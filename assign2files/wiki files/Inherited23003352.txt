Exactly as the name sounds, an @Inherited annotation type is inherited by subclasses of an annotated type.<br /><br /><br /><br />Code listing 1.2: Use of @Inherited<br /><br /><br />@Inherited<br />@interface ForEveryone { }<br /><br />@interface JustForMe { }<br /><br />@ForEveryone<br />@JustForMe<br />class Superclass { }<br /><br />class Subclass extends Superclass { }<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />In this example, Superclass has been explicitly annotated with both @ForEveryone and @JustForMe. Subclass hasn't been explicitly marked with either one; however, it inherits @ForEveryone because the latter is annotated with @Inherited. @JustForMe isn't annotated, so it isn't inherited by Subclass.
