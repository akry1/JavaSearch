Throughout this chapter, we will refer to the process of creating Graphical content with code as either drawing or painting. However, Java officially recognizes the latter as the proper word for the process, but we will differentiate between the two later on.<br />Now, the main class that you would be needing would, without doubt, be the Graphics class. If you take a closer look at the method that we used in theIdentifying the acquisition of the Graphics class in our code<br /><br /><br /><br />Code listing 9.3: A basic canvas<br /><br /><br />import java.awt.*;<br />import javax.swing.*;<br />public class MyCanvas extends Canvas {<br />    public MyCanvas() {<br />    }<br /><br />    public void paint(Graphics graphics) {<br />        /* We would be using this method only for the sake<br />         * of brevity throughout the current section.
