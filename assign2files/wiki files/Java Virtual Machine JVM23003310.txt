Quite possibly, the most important part of the JRE is the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The JVM acts like a virtual processor, enabling Java applications to be run on the local system. It's main purpose is to interpret (read translate) the received byte-code and make it appear as native code. The older Java architecture used this process of interpretation to execute Java byte-code. Even though the process of interpretation brought the WORA principle to diverse machines, it had a drawback â€” it consumed a lot of time and clocked the system processor intensively to load an application.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Figure 2: A JVM interpreter translates the byte-code line-by-line to make it appear as if a native application is being executed.
