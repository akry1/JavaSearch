For example, to compile and run a class from a project's top directory (that contains the two directories /source and /libraries) you could use the following command:<br /><br /><br /><br />Compilation<br /><br />$ javac -classpath libraries/lib.jar source/MainClass.java<br /><br /><br /><br />And then to run it, similarly:<br /><br /><br /><br />Execution<br /><br />$ java -classpath libraries/lib.jar source/MainClass<br /><br /><br /><br />The above is simplified, and demands that MainClass be in the default package, or a package called source, which isn't very desirable.
