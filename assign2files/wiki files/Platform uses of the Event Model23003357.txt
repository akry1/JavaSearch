The Event Model, as mentioned earlier, doesn't have a single all-encompassing implementation within the Java platform. Instead, the model serves as a basis for several different purpose-specific implementations, both within the standard Java platform and outside it (in frameworks).<br />Within the platform the main implementations are found in two areas:<br /><br />As part of the JavaBeans classes, particularly in the support classes for the implementation of PropertyChangeListeners.<br />As part of the Java standard UI frameworks, AWT and Swing.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />To do:<br />Add some exercises like the ones in Variables<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /> Streams<br />Java Programming<br />Event Handling<br />JavaBeans
