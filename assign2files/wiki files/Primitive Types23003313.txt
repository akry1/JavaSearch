The primitive types are used to represent boolean, character, and numeric values. This program uses only one primitive type explicitly, int, which represents 32 bit signed integer values. The program also implicitly uses double, which is the return type of the distance() method of java.awt.Point. double values are 64 bit IEEE floating point values. The main() method uses integer values 0, 1, 2, and 3 to access elements of the command line arguments. The Distance() constructor's four parameters also have the type int. Also, the intValue() method has a return type of int. This means a call to that method, such as intValue(args[0]), is an expression of type int. This helps explain why the main method cannot call:<br /><br /><br /><br />Code section 2.11: Wrong type.<br /><br /><br />1 new Distance(args[0], args[1], args[2], args[3]) // This is an error<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Since the type of the args array element is String, and our constructor's parameters must be int, such a call would result in an error because Java will not automatically convert values of type String into int values.<br />Java's primitive types are boolean, byte, char, short, int, long, float and double. Each of which are also Java language keywords.
