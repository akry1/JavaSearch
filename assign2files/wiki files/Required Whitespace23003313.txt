Look at the static method intValue:<br /><br /><br /><br />Code section 2.13: Method declaration<br /><br /><br />1 private static int intValue(String data) {<br />2   return Integer.parseInt(data);<br />3 }<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Whitespace is required between private and static, between static and int, between int and intValue, and between String and data.<br />If the code is written like this:<br /><br /><br /><br />Code section 2.14: Collapsed code<br /><br /><br />1 privatestaticint intValue(String data) {<br />2   return Integer.parseInt(data);<br />3 }<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />...it means something completely different: it declares a method which has the return type privatestaticint It is unlikely that this type exists and the method is no longer static, so the above would result in a semantic error.
