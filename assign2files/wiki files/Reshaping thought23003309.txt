The team started thinking of replacing C++ with a better version, a faster version, a responsive version. But the one thing they hadn't thought of, as of yet, was that the language they were aiming for had to be developed for an embedded system with limited resources. An embedded system is a computer system scaled to a minimalistic interface demanding only a few functions from its design. For such a system, C++ or any successor would seem too large as all the languages at the time demanded a larger footprint than what was desired. The team thus had to think in a different way to go about solving all these problems.<br />Co-founder of Sun Microsystems, Bill Joy, envisioned a language combining the power of Mesa and C in a paper he wrote for the engineers at Sun named Further. Gathering ideas, Gosling began work on enhancing C++ and named it "C++ ++ --", a pun on the evolutionary structure of the language's name. The ++ and -- meant, putting in and taking out stuff. He soon abandoned the name and called it Oak[1] after the tree that stood outside his office.<br /><br />Table 1: Who's who of the Java technology[1]<br />Has worked for GT (Green Team), FP (FirstPerson) and JP (Java Products Group)<br /><br />Name<br />GT<br />FP<br />JP<br />Details<br /><br /><br />Lisa Friendly<br /><br />Yes<br />Yes<br />FirstPerson employee and member of the Java Products Group<br /><br /><br />John Gage<br /><br /><br /><br />Science Office (Director), Sun Microsystems<br /><br /><br />James Gosling<br />Yes<br />Yes<br />Yes<br />Lead engineer and key architect of the Java technology<br /><br /><br />Bill Joy<br /><br /><br /><br />Co-founder and VP, Sun Microsystems; Principal designer of the UC Berkeley, version of the UNIXÂ® OS<br /><br /><br />Jonni Kanerva<br /><br />Yes<br /><br />Java Products Group employee, author of The Java FAQ1<br /><br /><br />Tim Lindholm<br /><br />Yes<br />Yes<br />FirstPerson employee and member Java Products Group<br /><br /><br />Scott McNealy<br /><br /><br /><br />Chairman, President, and CEO of Sun Microsystems<br /><br /><br />Patrick Naughton<br />Yes<br />Yes<br /><br />Green Team member, FirstPerson co-founder<br /><br /><br />George Paolini<br /><br /><br /><br />Corporate Marketing (Director), Sun's Java Software Division<br /><br /><br />Kim Polese<br /><br />Yes<br /><br />FirstPerson product marketing<br /><br /><br />Lisa Poulson<br /><br /><br /><br />Original director of public relations for Java technology (Burson-Marsteller)<br /><br /><br />Wayne Rosing<br /><br />Yes<br /><br />FirstPerson President<br /><br /><br />Eric Schmidt<br /><br /><br /><br />Former Sun Microsystems Chief Technology Officer<br /><br /><br />Mike Sheridan<br />Yes<br /><br /><br />Green Team member
