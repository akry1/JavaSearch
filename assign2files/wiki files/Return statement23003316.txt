A return statement exits from a block, so it is often the last statement of a method:<br /><br /><br /><br />Code section 3.9: A return statement.<br /><br /><br />1     public int getAge() {<br />2         int age = 24;<br />3         return age;<br />4     }<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />A return statement can return the content of a variable or nothing. Beware not to write statements after a return statement which would not be executed! Each return statement is ended by a semi-colon (;).
