The constructor is a special method called automatically when an object is created with the new keyword. Constructor does not have a return value and its name is the same as the class name. Each class must have a constructor. If we do not define one, the compiler will create a default so called empty constructor automatically.<br /><br /><br /><br />Code listing 3.13: Automatically created constructor.<br /><br /><br />1 public class MyClass {<br />2   /**<br />3   * MyClass Empty Constructor<br />4   */<br />5   public MyClass() {<br />6   }<br />7 }
