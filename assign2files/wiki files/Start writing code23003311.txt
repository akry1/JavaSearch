The most widely available text editor on GNOME desktops is Gedit, while on the KDE desktops, one can find Kate. Both these editors support syntax highlighting and code completion and therefore are sufficient for our purposes.<br />However, if you require a robust and standalone text-editor like the Notepad++ editor on Windows, you would require the use of the minimalistic editor loaded with features â€“ SciTE. Follow the instructions below if you wish to install SciTE:<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />1.<br />Open the Terminal window.<br /><br /><br />2.<br />At the prompt, write the following:<br /><br /><br /><br />Retrieving the java packages<br /><br />$ sudo apt-get install scite<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />3.<br />You should now be able to use SciTE for your programming needs. You may also want to try Geany. Installation instructions are similar to those for SciTE.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Installation instructions for Mac OS<br /><br />On Mac OS, both the JRE and the JDK are already installed.
