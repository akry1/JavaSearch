At times, you would like to re-iterate a loop without executing the remaining statement within the loop. The continue statement causes the loop to re-iterate and start over from the top most statement inside the loop.<br />Where there is an ability to re-iterate the loop, there is an ability to exit the loop when required. At any given moment, if you'd like to exit a loop and end all further work within the loop, the break ought to be used.<br />The continue and break statements can be used with a label like follows:<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Code section 3.19: Using a label.<br /><br /><br />1 String s = "A test string for the switch!\nLine two of test string...";<br />2 outer: for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {<br />3   switch (s.charAt(i)) {<br />4     case '\n': break outer;<br />5     case ' ': break;<br />6     default: System.out.print(s.charAt(i));<br />7   }<br />8 }<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Output for code listing 3.19<br /><br /> Ateststringfortheswitch!
