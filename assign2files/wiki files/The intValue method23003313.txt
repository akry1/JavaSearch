The intValue() method delegates its job to the Integer.parseInt() method. The main method could have called Integer.parseInt() directly; the intValue() method simply makes the main() method slightly more readable.<br /><br /><br /><br />Code section 2.10: intValue() method.<br /><br /><br />1 private static int intValue(String data) {<br />2    return Integer.parseInt(data);<br />3 }<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />This method is private since, like the fields point0 and point1, it is part of the internal implementation of the class and is not part of the external programming interface of the Distance class.
