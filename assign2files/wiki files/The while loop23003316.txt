Main page: Java Programming/Keywords/while<br /><br />The while loop iterates a block of code while the condition it specifies is true.<br />The syntax for the loop is:<br /><br />while (condition) {<br />   statement;<br /> }<br /><br />Here the condition is an expression. An expression as discussed earlier is any statement that returns a value. While condition statements evaluate to a boolean value, that is, either true or false. As long as the condition is true, the loop will iterate the block of code over and over and again. Once the condition evaluates to false, the loop exits to the next statement outside the loop.
