Released in September 2004<br /><br />Major changes include:<br /><br />Generics - Provides compile-time type safety for collectionsÂ :and eliminates the drudgery of casting.<br />Autoboxing/unboxing - Eliminates the drudgery of manual conversion between primitive types (such as int) and wrapper types (such as Integer).<br />Enhanced for - Shorten the for loop with Collections use.<br />Static imports - Lets you import all the static part of a class.<br />Annotation/Metadata - Enabling tools to generate code and deployment descriptors from annotations in the source code. This leads to a "declarative" programming style where the programmer says what should be done and tools emit the code to do it. Annotations can be inspected through source parsing or by using the additional reflection APIs added in Java 5.<br />JVM Improvements - Most of the run time library is now mapped into memory as a memory image, as opposed to being loaded from a series of class files. Large portion of the runtime libraries will now be shared among multiple JVM instances.
