Unicode characters can also be expressed through Unicode Escape Sequences. Unicode escape sequence may appear anywhere in a Java source file (including inside identifiers, comments, and string literals).<br />Unicode escape sequences consist of<br /><br />a backslash '\' (ASCII character 92, hex 0x5c),<br />a 'u' (ASCII 117, hex 0x75)<br />optionally one or more additional 'u' characters, and<br />four hexadecimal digits (the characters '0' through '9' or 'a' through 'f' or 'A' through 'F').<br /><br />Such sequences represent the UTF-16 encoding of a Unicode character. For example, 'a' is equivalent to '\u0061'. This escape method does not support characters beyond U+FFFF or you have to make use of surrogate pairs.[1]<br />Any and all characters in a program may be expressed in Unicode escape characters, but such programs are not very readable, except by the Java compiler - in addition, they are not very compact.<br />One can find a full list of the characters here.<br />Ï€ may also be represented in Java as the Unicode escape sequence \u03C0. Thus, the following is a valid, but not very readable, declaration and assignment:<br /><br /><br /><br />Code section 3.102: Unicode escape sequences for Pi.<br /><br /><br />1 double \u03C0 = Math.PI;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The following demonstrates the use of Unicode escape sequences in other Java syntax:<br /><br /><br /><br />Code section 3.103: Unicode escape sequences in a string literal.<br /><br /><br />1 // Declare Strings pi and quote which contain \u03C0 and \u0027 respectively:<br />2 String pi = "\u03C0";<br />3 String quote = "\u0027";<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Note that a Unicode escape sequence functions just like any other character in the source code. E.g., \u0022 (double quote, ") needs to be quoted in a string just like ".<br /><br /><br /><br />Code section 3.104: Double quote.<br /><br /><br />1 // Declare Strings doubleQuote1 and doubleQuote2 which both contain " (double quote):<br />2 String doubleQuote1 = "\"";<br />3 String doubleQuote2 = "\\u0022"; // "\u0022" doesn't work since """ doesn't work.
