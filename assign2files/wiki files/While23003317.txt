while loops are the simplest form of loop. The while loop repeats a block of code while the specified condition is true. Here is the structure of a while loop:<br /><br /><br />while (boolean expression1) {<br /><br />statement1<br />statement2<br />...<br />statementn<br /><br />}<br /><br /><br /><br />The loop's condition is checked before each iteration of the loop. If the condition is false at the start of the loop, the loop will not be executed at all. The code section 3.28 sets in squareHigherThan200 the smallest integer whose square exceeds 200.<br /><br /><br /><br />Code section 3.28: The smallest integer whose square exceeds 200.<br /><br /><br />1 int squareHigherThan200 = 0;<br />2 <br />3 while (squareHigherThan200 * squareHigherThan200 < 200) {<br />4   squareHigherThan200 = squareHigherThan200 + 1;<br />5 }<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />If a loop's condition will never become false, such as if the true constant is used for the condition, said loop is known as an infinite loop. Such a loop will repeat indefinitely unless it is broken out of. Infinite loops can be used to perform tasks that need to be repeated over and over again without a definite stopping point, such as updating a graphics display.
