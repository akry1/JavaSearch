private is a Java keyword which declares a member's access as private. That is, the member is only visible within the class, not from any other class (including subclasses). The visibility of private members extends to nested classes.<br />Please note: Because access modifiers are not handled at instance level but at class level, private members of an object are visible from other instances of the same class!<br /><br />Syntax:<br /><br />private void method();<br /><br />See also:<br /><br />Java Programming/Access Modifiers
